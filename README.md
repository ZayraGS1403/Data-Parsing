# Employee Data Analysis Project
  
**Student:** Zayra GutiÃ©rrez Solano

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze a synthetic dataset of employee records to identify patterns, relationships, and potential errors in the data. The dataset, `employee_data.csv`, contains employee information such as demographics, employment details, salary, performance scores, and work-related attributes. The project includes data cleaning, validation, visualization, and aims to explore distributions and relationships within the employee data, focusing on achieving a comprehensive understanding of workforce dynamics.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Validation

The script performs the following steps:

- **Data Validation:**
  - Identifies unrealistic values:
    - Salaries: Detects negative salaries.
    - Performance Scores: Ensures scores are within 0-100.
    - Ages: Ensures no employees are under 18.
    - Vacation and Sick Days: Detects negative values.
    - Days of Service: Detects negative values.
  - Validates `employee_id` format (EMP followed by 9 digits).
  - Checks for duplicate `employee_id`.
  - Validates dates (no future dates for `birth_date`, `hire_date`, `last_review_date`).
  - Detects inconsistencies in `days_service` vs. `hire_date` (differences >30 days).

### Data Structure

The `employee_data.csv` file contains the following columns:
